I post a mix of professional content and home/personal content on my website, and I categorize my posts accordingly. Separate RSS/Atom feeds are generated for each of those categories, and there is also a combined feed:
* [Professional](https://m.lemays.org/category/work/index.xml)
* [Home/personal](https://m.lemays.org/category/home/index.xml)
* [Combined](https://m.lemays.org/index.xml)
