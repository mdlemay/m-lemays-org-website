        I define and evaluate innovative security architectures for mitigating exploits and malware.  I draw on my expertise in architecture, compilers, operating systems, virtualization, HW/SW co-design, and formal methods to effectively devise solutions that are well-adapted to workload requirements.

        Co-lead liaison from Intel for the [SRC JUMP CONIX](https://conix.io) research center.
